# Week 6 - Weekend Homework (Part Two)
## Solo Project Scope Draft One

## Instructions

Using the examples we shared in class and the template document, write a first draft of your scope of work. Do this in google docs, so you can share it with us and we can give you feedback right in the document.

Do the following sections:

- **Application Overview**
- **Application Features**
	- Start thinking through your features. Write a description for each. No need for high fidelity mockups/wireframes for this draft, but having some visuals helps to understand how the application will work. Don't spend too much time making them look perfect, but maybe try hand drawing the first draft.
- **Technologies**
	- You might need to use a 3rd Party API or another node package to get all the functionality that you want. Do some research on these technologies. If you have the time consider trying that tool out or do a 'spike'. 

Share the google doc with us and submit the link here.
