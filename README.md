# Week 6 - Weekend Homework (Part Two)

## Solo Project Scope Draft One

Using the examples we shared in class, the template document and the common technologies list, write a first draft of your scope of work. Do this in google docs, so you can share it with us and we can give you feedback right in the document.

Do the following sections:

- **Application Overview**
- **Application Features**
	- Start thinking through your features. Write a description for each. Basic wireframes for your core functionality is preferable but not required at this point.
- **Technologies**
	- You might need to use a 3rd Party API or another node package to get all the functionality that you want. Do some research on these technologies. 
	- If you plan to use a third party API or tool, do a spike with these tools i.e. try the tool out. Come up with a simple example of how you might use it and write some code to do it. Play around with it to get practice using it on its own before pulling it into your project. **Using a third party library is not required.**

Share the google doc with us and submit the link here.
